# 🍕 PizzaRio Analytics: Building a Scalable Data System for a Small Business 
**From Raw Excel Files to a Fully Normalized SQL Database and Interactive Power BI Dashboards**

## 📄 Project Summary

This project presents a complete business analysis solution for a fictional pizza outlet, **PizzaRio**. The goal was to help the business owner streamline operations by improving visibility into orders, inventory, and staff management. The project follows the full data lifecycle — from understanding business requirements to designing a normalized SQL database and building insightful dashboards in Power BI.

The process involved:
- Gathering and structuring raw business data in Excel
- Normalizing the data and designing a relational schema
- Writing optimized SQL queries and creating views
- Connecting Power BI to SQL views via DirectQuery
- Creating interactive dashboards for decision-making

It is designed as a **portfolio project** to demonstrate core skills in data modeling, SQL querying, and Power BI reporting — suitable for real-world small business analytics.
